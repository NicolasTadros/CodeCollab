ðŸ›  Built With 
Frontend:
-React
-Socket.io Client
-Lucide Icons

Backend:
-Node.js + Express

-MongoDB + Mongoose for data persistence

âš™ How It Works

Each room has its own unique URL where users can join and start coding together.
The editor syncs changes instantly and displays each participantâ€™s cursor position.

Code execution is handled server-side in isolated environments, and rooms persist their code in MongoDB so you can pick up right where you left off.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Project is Useful

This project solves a common problem for developers, students, and interviewers â€” the need to collaborate on code in real time without complex setup.

Instead of screen sharing or constantly sending files back and forth, collaborators can:

-See changes instantly

-Run code in multiple languages

-Track whoâ€™s active in the session

Itâ€™s ideal for:

-Pair programming without needing to be in the same location

-Technical interviews focused on problem-solving, not setup

-Live coding sessions for teaching or workshops

-Hackathons where speed and teamwork matter
